This project is a simple spring boot web application I am using to see how to create and deploy zarf (https://zarf.dev) packages for java applications.

Initial app is adapted from https://github.com/binblee/springboot-helm-chart and then zarf configuration added.

I have not linked it to any CICD or github actions yet, but for local tinkering you can do the following:

## Build the docker image

```
cd demoweb
docker compose build
```
This should do a multi stage build and build the docker image for the application and put it in the local docker registry.

View the image using 'docker images' to see it as shown below:

```
REPOSITORY                        TAG                   IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
ericwyles/springboot-helm-chart   jre-17                6af4dc3f15a0   10 minutes ago   288MB
```

There is a helm chart at demoweb/charts/springboot-demoweb/Chart.yaml that ultimately references the above image in the deployment.yaml as below

```
      containers:
        - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
          securityContext:
            {{- toYaml .Values.securityContext | nindent 12 }}
          image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag | default .Chart.AppVersion }}"
          imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}
```

With values coming from values.yaml for the repository, tag and version:

```
image:
  repository: ericwyles/springboot-helm-chart
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  # Overrides the image tag whose default is the chart appVersion.
  tag: "jre-17"

```


## Build the zarf package

After the docker image is built, run the following from the root of the repository

```
zarf package create
```

Answer the prompts and this will produce a zarf package called 'zarf-package-ewyles-spring-boot-demo-arm64-1.0.0.tar.zst' in the current directory.

### View SBOM

You can view the sbom by running 'zarf package inspect -s <package name>' and you'll get an output as shown below and it will launch the sbom viewer in your web browser:

## Deploy the zarf package

Assuming you already have a kubernetes cluster with zarf initialized, run 'zarf package deploy <package name>'

It will print quite a bit of metadata and should finish with this:
